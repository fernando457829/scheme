<h2 align="center">Musicorum Scheme 1.0 </h2>

> This scheme is still a draft

The Musicorum Scheme 1.0 defines the request rules for a standard communication.
#### Table of contents

1. [Workers](#workers)
  1.1 [Lookup](#lookup)
2. [Resource Manager](#resource-manager)
  2.1 [Fetch Spotify Artists](#spotify-artists)


<h2 align="center" id="workers">Workers</h2>
<h3 id="lookup">Lookup</h3>
The lookup connection corresponds as the first connection from the gateway to the worker nodes to define the availability of the nodes and their available themes.

For each node, the gateway must make the following request and response:
`GET http://worker.node/worker`

```json
{
  "name": String,
  "engine": String,
  "version": Float,
  "scheme": Float,
  "themes": String[]
}
```

<details>
  <summary>Example</summary>

  ```json
  Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

  {
    "name": "rachel",
    "engine": "chloe",
    "version": 1.0,
    "scheme": 1.0,
    "themes": [
      "grid"
    ]
  }

  Response code: 200 (OK); Time: 16ms; Content length: 79 bytes
```
</details>

<br />
With the response, the gateway should map all the themes with their available workers.
